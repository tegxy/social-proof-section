**The Challenge:** 
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

**Process**

Built with

- VScode
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

**What I learned**
Being that I'm still learning frontend development, I was able work on a few things for the first time and understand them properly.
Some of the CSS properties learnt were: 
- how and when to using positioning
- how to use html semantics
- more knowledge on divs, their height and width
- how to also use psuedo-classes and hover states
- how to use grid and flex at thesame time 
- how to use media query ( understanding the different break points)
    @media (max-width: 768px) {}
